# youtube-dl-album

This is a small node.js I wrote at some moment to download an entire album (as one video) with youtube-dl, extract the sound, parse the description, cut the sound into single tracks and finally assign all given MP3 tags to each of the tracks. Pretty useful sometimes...

No dependencies other than node.js
